agent libraries such as newrelic should end up here

For simplicity, your build system should end up writing a consistent name as a jar file.
For example for newrelic, Apache Ivy can be used to consistently retrieve the artifact name as newrelic.jar, no matter the version.

YMMV depending on your build system.
